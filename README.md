Hi there! 

My name is [Noviria Syifaun Nafsi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noviria-syifaun-nafsi), a master's student in [Agricultural Sciences and Resource Management in the Tropics and Subtropics (ARTS)](https://www.arts.uni-bonn.de/) at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en). This is my learning logbook for the course ["Tree Phenology Analysis with R"](https://hortibonn.github.io/Tree-Phenology/). 

In this course, we use `chillR` package for R which have been developing by [Prof. Dr. Eike Luedeling](https://inresgb-lehre.iaas.uni-bonn.de/author/prof.-dr.-eike-luedeling/) since 2013.

I will be sharing my learning progress during this course in this repository.
