# **1. Introduction**

Hi there! 

My name is [Noviria Syifaun Nafsi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noviria-syifaun-nafsi), a master's student in [Agricultural Sciences and Resource Management in the Tropics and Subtropics (ARTS)](https://www.arts.uni-bonn.de/) at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en). This is my learning logbook for the course of ["Tree Phenology Analysis with R"](https://hortibonn.github.io/Tree-Phenology/). 

In this course, we use **`chillR`** package for R which have been developing by [Prof. Dr. Eike Luedeling](https://inresgb-lehre.iaas.uni-bonn.de/author/prof.-dr.-eike-luedeling/) since 2013.

I will be sharing my learning progress during this course in this logbook.

# **2. The tools we use**

In this course, the tools we use are RStudio and GitHub.

Here are some videos from [Dr. Cory Whitney](https://inresgb-lehre.iaas.uni-bonn.de/author/dr.-cory-whitney/) to introduce you with the tools:

# **3. Tree dormancy**

Here are my answers for the exercises from this lecture:

**3.1 Put yourself in the place of a breeder who wants to calculate the temperature requirements of a newly released cultivar. Which method will you use to calculate the chilling and forcing periods? Please justify your answer.**


*Answer:*

_As a breeder, I think I will decide the method that I will be using depending on the siuation (?)_


**3.2 Which are the advantages (2) of the BBCH scale compared with earlies scales?**

*Answer:*

_As a breeder, I think I will decide the method that I will be using depending on the siuation (?)_


**3.3 Classify the following phenological stages of sweet cherry according to the BBCH scale:**

*Answer:*

_As a breeder, I think I wil decide the method that I will be using depending on the siuation (?)_


# **4. Climate change and impact projection**

Here are my answers for the exercises from this lecture:

**4.1 List the main drivers of climate change at the decade to century scale, and briefly explain the mechanism through which the currently most important driver affects our climate.**

*Answer:*

_As a breeder, I think I wil decide the method that I will be using depending on the siuation (?)_

**4.2 Explain briefly what is special about temperature dynamics of recent decades, and why we have good reasons to be concerned.**

*Answer:*

_As a breeder, I think I wil decide the method that I will be using depending on the siuation (?)_


**4.3 What does the abbreviation ‘RCP’ stand for, how are RCPs defined, and what is their role in projecting future climates?**

*Answer:*

_As a breeder, I think I wil decide the method that I will be using depending on the siuation (?)_


**4.4 Briefly describe the 4 climate impact projection methods described in the fourth video.**

*Answer:*

_As a breeder, I think I wil decide the method that I will be using depending on the siuation (?)_


# **5. Winter chill projections**

Here are my answers for the exercises from this lecture:

**5.1 Sketch out three data access and processing challenges that had to be overcome in order to produce chill projections with state-of-the-art methodology.**

*Answer:*

_As a breeder, I think I wil decide the method that I will be using depending on the siuation (?)_


**5.2 Outline, in your understanding, the basic steps that are necessary to make such projections.**

*Answer:*

_As a breeder, I think I wil decide the method that I will be using depending on the siuation (?)_


# **6. Manual chill analysis**

**`Exercises`** on basic chill modeling

**6.1 Write a basic function that calculates warm hours (>25°C)**

*Answer:*

_As a breeder, I think I wil decide the method that I will be using depending on the siuation (?)_



**6.2 Apply this function to the Winters_hours_gaps dataset**

*Answer:*

_As a breeder, I think I wil decide the method that I will be using depending on the siuation (?)_


**6.3 Extend this function, so that it can take start and end dates as inputs and sums up warm hours between these dates**

*Answer:*

_As a breeder, I think I wil decide the method that I will be using depending on the siuation (?)_





```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
